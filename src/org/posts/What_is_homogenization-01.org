#+TITLE: What is homogenization? Part 1: on the separation of scales
#+DATE: [2019-03-28 Thu]

Most of my research activities deal with upscaling the mechanical properties of
heterogeneous materials. This is also known as homogenization. So what /is/
homogenization? This series explores this question; it is largely based on the
introduction to my [[file:./20171117-Announcing_the_defense_of_my_habilitation.org][Habilitation defense]].

In order to introduce homogenization, we will draw inspiration from the
publishing industry. Meet Calvin and Hobbes

From where you seat, Hobbes' nose looks perfectly smooth, uniformly gray.
However, let us take a closer look.

It turns out that the nose has a /dotted/ structure, which is inherent to the
printing technique itself. The reason why the resulting picture looks fine is
because you are looking at it from far off. We speak about /separation of
scales/. In this example, three length-scales can be identified

  - the /microscopic/ length-scale $L_\mu$ is the size of the dots
  - the /mesoscopic/ length-scale $L_\mathrm{m}$ is the size of the gray patch
    (the nose)
  - the /macroscopic/ length-scale $L_\mathrm{M}$ is the distance from your
    screen to your eye.

These three scales are well separated, which means that the macro scale is much larger than the meso scale, which in turn is much larger than the micro scale
\begin{equation}
L_\mu\ll L_\mathrm{m}\ll L_\mathrm{M}.
\end{equation}

Provided that separation of scales prevails, homogenization can take
place. Homogenization is the process of replacing the complex microstructure
with an equivalent, /homogeneous/ mesostructure.

The /microstructure/ denotes both the geometry and physical properties of the
microscopic features. In the present case, the microstructure is defined by the
size and spacing of the dots, as well as the color of dots and background.

The /mesostructure/ is a patch with homogeneous, equivalent properties (in the
present case: uniform grey color).
