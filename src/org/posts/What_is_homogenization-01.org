#+TITLE: What is homogenization? Part 1: on the separation of scales
#+DATE: [2019-03-28 Thu]

Most of my research activities deal with upscaling the mechanical properties of
heterogeneous materials. This is also known as homogenization. So what /is/
homogenization? This series explores this question; it is largely based on the
introduction to my [[file:./20171117-Announcing_the_defense_of_my_habilitation.org][Habilitation defense]].

In order to introduce homogenization, we will draw inspiration from the
publishing industry. The following photograph was published in “Le Journal” (a
french daily newspaper) from Thursday, may 30^th, 1935 (num. 15565). It
illustrates the first cruise of the ocean liner /Normandie/.

From where you sit, water exhibits nice shades of gray. However, let us take a closer look:

It turns out that the sea has a /dotted/ structure, which is inherent to the
so-called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone][halftoning]] technique itself. The reason why the resulting picture
looks fine is because you are looking at it from far off. We speak about
/separation of scales/. In this example, three length-scales can be identified

  - the /microscopic/ length-scale L_μ is the size of the dots,
  - the /mesoscopic/ length-scale L_m is the typical size of the blue patches
    (the column spacing),
  - the /macroscopic/ length-scale L_M is the distance from your screen to your
    eye.

These three scales are well separated, which means that the macro scale is much
larger than the meso scale, which in turn is much larger than the micro scale:
L_μ \thinsp\ll\thinsp L_m \thinsp\ll\thinsp L_M.

Provided that separation of scales prevails, homogenization can take
place. Homogenization is the process of replacing the complex microstructure
with an equivalent, /homogeneous/ mesostructure. By /microstructure/, we mean
both the geometry and physical properties of the microscopic features. In the
above example, the microstructure is defined by the size and spacing of the
dots (geometry), as well as the color of dots and background (physical
properties). The /mesostructure/ on the other hand is a patch with homogeneous,
equivalent (in homogenization language, we say /effective/) properties. In the
above example, the effective property is the uniform blue color as perceived by
the observer.

Two strategies can be adopted to carry out homogenization. In the so-called
/top-down/ approach, the effective properties are /measured/ (in a broad
sense). In the example above, we could provide the observer with a set of cards
uniformly coloured with various shades of blue, and ask him to pick the card
which is closest to how the blue sky looks from far off. The alternate,
/bottom-up/ approach is often referred to as /upscaling/. In this approach, the
effective properties are /inferred/ (through a mathematical model) from the
microstructure. In the example above, we could /predict/ the effective blue
shade of the lithograph's sky by some kind of weighted average of the blue
shade of the dots, and the white background.

These two strategies should not be seen as competing, but rather as
complementary approaches to the same problem. While the top-down approach
always delivers the “correct” answer (provided that the experiments are
performed correctly), efficient bottom-up approaches have the ability to be
/predictive/: given the microstructure, the effective properties can be
computed with no need to actually /build/ the microstructure. This is
particularly desirable in an industrial context, where numerical modelling is
gradually supplanting physical testing.

In my research, I preferably resort to bottom-up approaches. The remainder of
this series will therefore be devoted to homogenization through upscaling.

* Conclusion

In this post, we introduced the homogenization concept through a graphical
analogy. We explained that the key ingredient for homogenization to be valid is
separation of scales.

In the next instalment of this series, we will discuss homogenization in the
context of the mechanical properties of heterogeneous materials.
