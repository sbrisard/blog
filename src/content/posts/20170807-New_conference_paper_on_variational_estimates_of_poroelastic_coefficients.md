Title: New conference paper on variational estimates of poroelastic coefficients

Category: Publications

I recently had the pleasure to give a talk on “Variational estimates
of the poroelastic coefficients” at the 6th Biot Conference on
Poromechanics that took place at École des Ponts ParisTech on July
9-13, 2017. This is joint work with my colleague [Siavash
GHABEZLOO](http://navier.enpc.fr/GHABEZLOO-Siavash). It has been
ongoing for years now, but for lack of time, the full paper is still
not out!  (To tell the truth, I need to find and correct a mistake in
the illustrative application…).

Meanwhile, the preprint of the conference paper is now online on
[HAL](https://hal-enpc.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01561591); you can also
find the slides of my talk
[there](https://hal-enpc.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01561564). The
abstract is reproduced below

> Saturated, isotropic, poroelastic materials are classically described
> by their elastic stiffness, one Biot coefficient and one Biot modulus
> (Coussy 2010; Dormieux, Molinari, and Kondo 2002). The situation
> becomes more complex for unsaturated, isotropic, poroelastic materials
> that require multiple Biot coefficients and moduli (Coussy and Brisard
> 2009). These poroelastic coefficients are dependent and linked by
> several linear relationships. Micromechanical estimates of these
> coefficients have been proposed by several authors (Ulm,
> Constantinides, and Heukamp 2004; Pichler and Hellmich 2010). However,
> these estimates may fail to fulfill the linear relationships that
> relate the exact poroelastic coefficients. This might be regarded as
> an undesirable inconsistency of the model. In this work, we propose
> new, consistent (in the sense that the above mentioned linear
> relationships are preserved) estimates of the poroelastic
> coefficients. Our point of departure is the principle of Hashin and
> Shtrikman, suitably extended to eigenstressed materials (Bornert et
> al. 2001). Adopting stress-polarization fields that are similar to the
> eigenstress-free case (Willis 1977; Ponte Castañeda andWillis 1995)
> allows us to derive variational estimates of the poroelastic
> coefficients, which can be shown to fulfill all known linear
> relationships required from the exact values. After outlining the
> derivation within the general framework of eigenstressed,
> heterogeneous materials, the results will be specialized to
> poroelasticity. This will lead to a variational justification of the
> ad-hoc pore isodeformation assumption (Coussy and Brisard 2009).

This was the first time someone ever twitted about one of my talks!
