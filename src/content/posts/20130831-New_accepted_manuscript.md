It is my pleasure to announce that one of my papers has recently been
accepted for publication in the Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of
Solids. It's called *New boundary conditions for the computation of the
apparent stiffness of statistical volume elements*.

It introduces a new set of boundary conditions to be applied to a
*finite-size* Statistical Volume Element. The resulting problem can be
solved in a natural way with the help of the Green operator for strains
of the whole space. Also, a mathematical framework is proposed for the
analysis of linear elasticity problems in the whole (unbounded space).
