My student Vinh Phuc Tran has recently had one of his papers published
in *Mechanics of Materials*. The paper is called *Stochastic modeling of
mesoscopic elasticity random field*. The abstract is reproduced below

> In the homogenization setting, the effective properties of a
> heterogeneous material can be retrieved from the solution of the
> so-called corrector problem. In some cases of practical interest,
> obtaining such a solution remains a challenging computational task
> requiring an extremely fine discretization of microstructural
> features. In this context, Bignonnet et al. recently proposed a
> framework where smooth mesoscopic elasticity random fields are defined
> through a filtering procedure. In this work, we investigate the
> capabilities of information-theoretic random field models to
> accurately represent such mesoscopic elasticity fields. The aim is to
> substantially reduce the homogenization cost through the use of
> coarser discretizations while solving mesoscale corrector problems.
> The analysis is performed on a simple but non-trivial model
> microstructure. First of all, we recall the theoretical background
> related to the filtering and multiscale frameworks, and subsequently
> characterize some statistical properties of the filtered stiffness
> field. Based on these properties, we further introduce a random field
> model and address its calibration through statistical estimators and
> the maximum likelihood principle. Finally, the validation of the model
> is discussed by comparing some quantities of interest that are
> obtained either from numerical experiments on the underlying random
> microstructure or from model-based simulations. It is shown that for
> the case under study, the information-theoretic model can be
> calibrated with a limited set of realizations and still allows for
> accurate predictions of the effective properties.
