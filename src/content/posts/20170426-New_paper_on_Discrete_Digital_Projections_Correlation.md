Our paper “Discrete Digital Projections Correlation: a
reconstruction-free method to quantify local kinematics in granular
media by X-ray tomography” has recently been published in *Experimental
Mechanics*. The abstract is reproduced below

> We propose a new method to measure the translations and rotations of
> each individual grain in a granular material imaged by computerized
> tomography. Unlike the classic approach, which requires that both
> initial and current configurations be fully reconstructed, ours only
> requires a reconstruction of the initial configuration. In this sense,
> our method is reconstruction-free, since any subsequent deformed state
> can be analyzed without further reconstruction. One distinguishing
> feature of the proposed method is that it requires very few
> projections of the deformed sample, thus allowing for time-resolved
> experiments.
