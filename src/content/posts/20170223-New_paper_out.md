My paper “Towards improved Hashin--Shtrikman bounds on the effective
moduli of random composites” has recently been published in *Mechanics &
Industry*. The abstract is reproduced below

> The celebrated bounds of Hashin and Shtrikman on the effective
> properties of composites are valid for a very wide class of materials.
> However, they incorporate only a very limited amount of information on
> the microstructure (volume fraction of each phase in the case of
> isotropic microstructures). As a result, they are generally not tight.
> In this work, we present an attempt at improving these bounds by
> incorporating explicitly the local volume fraction to the set of local
> descriptors of the microstructure. We show that, quite unexpectedly,
> the process fails in the sense that the classical bounds are
> retrieved. We further show that this negative result applies to
> so-called weakly isotropic local descriptors of the microstructure (to
> be defined in this paper). This suggests that improved bounds may be
> obtained with anisotropic descriptors.
