#+TITLE: Extract images from PDF files
#+SETUPFILE: "../../header.org"
#+HTML_HEAD_EXTRA: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../../solarized.css" />

I recently scanned a document as a PDF file, and I wanted to retrieve the embedded images. I really mean /extract/ the images, and not convert the pages of the document to images (which would entail loss of data).@@html:<!-- more -->@@ There is a nice command-line tool to do that: =pdfimages=, which ships with [[http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/index.html][Xpdf]]. To extract all images embedded in =document.pdf=

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
pdfimages -j document.pdf $PATH-TO-DEST
#+END_EXAMPLE

Where =PATH-TO-DEST= is the path to a directory where the extracted images should be stored.
