As of Python 3, the operator =/= performs a /true/ division (floating-point result). If you are looking for an integer division (quotient of the Euclidean division), you must use =//=. For example

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  >>> 1 / 2
  0.5
  >>> 5 // 2
  2
#+END_SRC

As far as I am concerned, I have no doubt that it will lead to endless debugging sessions!
