#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The goals of MPICH are:
  1. to provide an MPI implementation that efficiently supports different computation and communication platforms including commodity clusters (desktop systems, shared-memory systems, multicore architectures), high-speed networks and proprietary high-end computing systems (Blue Gene, Cray)
  2. to enable cutting-edge research in MPI through an easy-to-extend modular framework for other derived implementations
#+END_QUOTE

I didn't manage to compile MPICH with MinGW and had to resort to precompiled binaries, which can be downloaded from the [[http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36045][Microsoft website]] (HPC Pack 2012 MS-MPI Redistributable Package). Install this pack to e.g. =C:\opt\Microsoft_HPC_Pack_2012=. To check that MPI indeed works, edit the following =hello.c= file

#+BEGIN_SRC c
  #include <stdio.h>
  #include <mpi.h>
  
  int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    int rank, size;
  
    MPI_Init (&argc, &argv);
    MPI_Comm_rank (MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);
    MPI_Comm_size (MPI_COMM_WORLD, &size);
    printf( "Hello world from process %d of %d\n", rank, size);
    MPI_Finalize();
    return 0;
  }
#+END_SRC

When using this precompiled library with MinGW, you might run into the following error

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  c:/opt/Microsoft_HPC_Pack_2012/Inc/mpi.h:137:1: error: unknown type name '__int64' typedef __int64 MPI_Offset;
#+END_EXAMPLE

=__int64__= is defined in the header file =_mingw.h=, so I just added the following line

#+BEGIN_SRC c
  #include <_mingw.h>
#+END_SRC

at the top of file =C:\opt\Microsoft_HPC_Pack_2012\Inc\mpi.h=.

This pack does not ship with a version of =mpicc=. Therefore, to compile, you need to specify the full path to the MPI headers and libraries

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ mingw32-gcc -o hello.exe hello.c -I/C/opt/Microsoft_HPC_Pack_2012/Inc -L/C/opt/Microsoft_HPC_Pack_2012/Lib/i386 -lmsmpi
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note that the program is linked against the 32 bit library, as the standard MinGW is a 32 bit system. Then run the example::

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ /C/opt/Microsoft_HPC_Pack_2012/Bin/mpiexec.exe -np 4 hello.exe
  Hello world from process 3 of 4
  Hello world from process 1 of 4
  Hello world from process 2 of 4
  Hello world from process 0 of 4
#+END_EXAMPLE

It works!
