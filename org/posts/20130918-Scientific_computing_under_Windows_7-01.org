#+TITLE: Scientific computing under Windows 7, part 1: MinGW
#+DATE: <2013-09-18 Wed>

The natural OS of choice for scientific computing is of course Linux. However, running Linux on a laptop means short battery life, problems with drivers, and so on. Do not mistake me: I LOVE Linux, and have been using it since 1998 (my first distro was actually Mandrake 1.0, long gone!). However, I must admit that Linux has made little progress in terms of energy management, while Windows has improved a lot in terms of stability, to the point that it now becomes possible to use under Windows (almost) all the tools that I came to love under Linux.

I recently reverted to Windows 7 on my professional laptop. This means that a lot of scientific tools, which come as packages in any decent Linux distro, must be installed by hand. In this series, I intend to report on the installation of these tools, and the manual tweaking that is sometimes (well, often... okay, most of the times) required.

The first tool, or rather set of tools I'm going to describe is [[http://www.mingw.org/][MinGW]], a contraction of "Minimalist GNU for Windows". It provides Windows binaries of all GNU compilation tools (=gcc=, =automake=, =autoconf=, ...). In turn, this suite will be extensively used to compile the libraries and programs that I need.

Installation of MinGW, through the GUI =mingw-get-setup.exe= is fairly smooth. I chose =C:\MinGW\= as root directory for the MinGW system. Feel free to change this location, but avoid spaces in the full path. At the time of writing, I have installed the following packages

After installation, you must edit =C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\etc\fstab=, and add the following line

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  C:\MinGW  /mingw
#+END_EXAMPLE

By default, MinGW sets up your home directory to point to =/home/$LOGNAME/=. If you want it to point to your Windows home instead, edit =C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\etc\profile=, and replace the line

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  HOME = "/home/$LOGNAME"
#+END_EXAMPLE

with

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  HOME = "$USERPROFILE"
#+END_EXAMPLE

... and you should be ready to go!
