#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The OpenMP API defines a portable, scalable model with a simple and flexible interface for developing parallel applications on platforms from the desktop to the supercomputer.
#+END_QUOTE

To use OpenMP with MinGW, you must install the following packages (using the =mingw-get= installer)

  - =mingw32-pthreads-w32=,
  - =mingw32-libgomp=.

To check that OpenMP indeed works, create the following =hello.c= source file

#+BEGIN_SRC c
#include <omp.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char argv[]) {
  int id;
#pragma omp parallel private(id)
  {
    id = omp_get_thread_num();
    printf("%d: Hello World!\n", id);
  }
  return 0;
}
#+END_SRC

and compile it as follows (in the MSYS console)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ gcc -fopenmp -o hello hello.c
#+END_EXAMPLE

Running the resulting executable on my laptop (4 processors) leads to the following output

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ ./hello.exe
2: Hello World!
0: Hello World!
1: Hello World!
3: Hello World!
#+END_EXAMPLE
