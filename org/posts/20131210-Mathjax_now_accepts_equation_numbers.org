#+TITLE: MathJax now accepts equation numbers
#+DATE: <2013-12-10 Tue>

As of version 2.0, MathJax can [[http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/tex.html#automatic-equation-numbering][number equations automatically]].@@html:<!-- more -->@@ To enable this feature, the following lines must be added /before/ the =<script>= tag that loads MathJax itself

#+BEGIN_SRC html
  <script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
    MathJax.Hub.Config({
        TeX: {equationNumbers: {autoNumber: "AMS"}}
    });
  </script>
#+END_SRC

Then, the following lines

#+BEGIN_SRC html
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:1}
    (a + b)^2=a^2+2ab+b^2
  \end{equation}

  <p>
  Eq. \eqref{eq:1} shows that the square of the sum of $a$ and $b$ is
  <em>not</em> the sum of squares of $a$ and $b$.
  <p>
#+END_SRC

produce

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1}
(a + b)^2=a^2+2ab+b^2
\end{equation}

Eq. \eqref{eq:1} shows that the square of the sum of $a$ and $b$ is /not/ the sum of squares of $a$ and $b$.

I will try and update this whole blog accordingly.
