#+PROPERTY: header-args:ipython :session :eval no-export :exports both

In this new series, we will explore the so-called /periodic-plus-smooth/
decomposition of an image, introduced by Moisan in 2011. This series is largely
based on Moisan's paper, called [[https://doi.org/10.1007/s10851-010-0227-1][Periodic plus Smooth Image Decomposition]] (the
author's version can be found on [[https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00388020][HAL]]). Besides introducing a quite smart
technique (that I do use for real materials science applications), this series
will be an opportunity to discuss an important topic: how to test the
implementation of an algorithm, and be confident that the test actually
validates the implementation.

To do so, I will first define the periodic-plus-smooth decomposition as a
minimiazation problem. This will lead to a first implementation of this
decomposition: the objective function is quadratic, and the minimization problem
therefore merely reduces to a linear system. However, this system is large (the
number of unknowns is the number of pixels!). We will therefore use matrix-free
techniques.

This first –quite inefficient– implementation will then serve as a reference
implementation of the decomposition, for testing purposes. Indeed, Moisan showed
that the minimization problem he introduced could in fact be explicitely solved
in Fourier space. He proposed two efficient algorithms to compute the
decomposition. Both rely, of course, on the FFT. We will implement both, test
them against the reference implementation, and compare their merits.

That's a lot of work! So, without further ado, let's start introducing this
decomposition!

* The need for periodic images

Let us start by briefly discussing what /is/ a periodic image, and why we would
ever need one. Loosely speaking, an image is periodic if placing copies of the
same image on a 2×2 grid can be done (almost) seamlessly. Remember that an image
is defined for a /discrete/ set of pixels, and that the pixel values themselves
are also /discrete/. Therefore, it is not possible to refer to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function][continuity]] of
an image, which explains why it is difficult to define periodic images more
precisely.

It is actually easier to verify that an image is /not/ periodic. Let us consider
the following image as an example (see Figure [[fig:1]]).

#+CAPTION: The original image.
#+NAME: fig:1
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 80%
[[sb-blog-data-dir:hut-648x364.png]]

Instead of putting aside 4 copies of the same image, we can simply swap the
quadrants, as shown in Figure [[fig:2]]. Alternatively, you could also ask my
three-year old daughter if her hut is periodic ;-). In Figure [[fig:2]], the four
corners certainly do /not/ join seamlessly at the center, which is a sure
indication that the image is not periodic.

#+CAPTION: swapped quadrants.
#+NAME: fig:2
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 80%
[[sb-blog-data-dir:hut-648x364-fftshift.png]]

It should be noted that the image shown in Figure [[fig:2]] is readily produced with
the [[https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.fft.fftshift.html#numpy-fft-fftshift][numpy.fft.fftshift]] function, as illustrated by the following code
snippet[fn:1]

#+HEADER: :var DATA_DIR=(cdr (assoc "sb-blog-data-dir" org-link-abbrev-alist-local))
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :results silent
  import numpy as np
  import scipy.misc

  iname = DATA_DIR+'hut-648x364.png'
  oname = DATA_DIR+'hut-648x364-fftshift.png'

  u = scipy.misc.imread(iname)
  scipy.misc.imsave(oname, np.fft.fftshift(u))
#+END_SRC

Why would this lack of periodicity be a problem? Well, many image analysis
techniques rely on the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform][fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) for efficiency. In turn, the
discrete Fourier transform implicitely assumes that the data is periodic;
otherwise, artifacts can result. An archetypal example is the power spectrum of
an image (we shall come back to this specific issue in a dedicated series). The
power spectrum of Figure [[fig:1]] is displayed in Figure [[fig:3]] below; the following
code snippet was executed to produce this image.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :results silent
  u_dft = np.fft.fft2(u)
  u_ps = np.abs(np.fft.fftshift(u_dft))**2
  a = np.log10(u_ps)
  a_min, a_max = np.min(a), np.max(a)
  a = 255*(a-a_min)/(a_max-a_min)
  img = a.astype(np.uint8)

  oname = DATA_DIR+'hut-648x364-power_spectrum.png'
  scipy.misc.imsave(oname, img)
#+END_SRC

#+CAPTION: The power spectrum of the image shown in Figure [[fig:1]].
#+NAME: fig:3
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 80%
[[sb-blog-data-dir:hut-648x364-power_spectrum.png]]

In Figure [[fig:3]], the bright cross at the center is the signature of the jumps
across the boundaries of the image. Indeed, remember that discontinuities at
large correlation lengths translate to oscillations at low frequencies (the
center of the power spectrum image).

* Periodization by symmetrization

Of course, it is possible to enforce periodicity by tiling together 4 mirror
images of the same initial image as follows (see figure [[fig:4]])

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :results silent
  m, n = u.shape
  left, right = slice(0, m), slice(2*m-1, m-1, -1)
  top, bottom = slice(0, n), slice(2*n-1, n-1, -1)
  u_mirrored = np.zeros((2*m, 2*n), dtype=u.dtype)
  u_mirrored[left, bottom] = u
  u_mirrored[right, bottom] = u
  u_mirrored[left, top] = u
  u_mirrored[right, top] = u
  scipy.misc.imsave(DATA_DIR+'hut-648x364-mirrored.png', u_mirrored)
#+END_SRC

#+CAPTION: Periodization by symmetrization of the image shown in
#+CAPTION: Figure [[fig:1]].
#+NAME: fig:4
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 80%
[[sb-blog-data-dir:hut-648x364-mirrored.png]]

This indeed makes the power spectrum

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :results silent
  a = np.abs(np.fft.fftshift(np.fft.fft2(u_mirrored)))**2
  a[a==0.0]=1.0
  a = np.log10(a)
  a_min, a_max = np.min(a), np.max(a)
  a = 255*(a-a_min)/(a_max-a_min)

  scipy.misc.imsave(DATA_DIR+'hut-648x364-mirrored-power_spectrum.png',
                    a.astype(np.uint8))
#+END_SRC

This does not remove entirely the cross at the center of the power
spectrum. Worse, "it makes the DFT symmetric and real-valued, which can be
dramatic if the phase component of the Fourier transform has to be analyzed, or
if orientation issues are concerned" ([[https://doi.org/10.1007/s10851-010-0227-1][Moisan, 2011]]). This led Moisan to
introduce the /periodic-plus-smooth/ decomposition.

* Conclusion

In this post, we set the stage for the subsequent instalments of this series,
arguing that it is sometimes desirable that an image should be periodic. In the
next instalment of this series, we will define the /periodic-plus-smooth/
decomposition of Moisan ([[https://doi.org/10.1007/s10851-010-0227-1][2011]]). We will then turn to the implementation of this
decomposition.

[fn:1] In this code snippet, you should not pay attention to the fact that
=DATA_DIR= has not been defined. I actually used some [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][Org-babel]] tricks to define
this variable programatically from =emacs-lisp=.
