#+DATE: <2013-09-04 Wed>

[[https://bitbucket.org/petsc/petsc4py][petsc4py]] can pass command line arguments to =PETSc=, such as the very useful =-log_summary=. This would typically be done by passing these arguments to =petsc4py.init()=. However, this command must be invoked before any other =petsc4py= command. In other words

#+BEGIN_SRC python :exports code
  from petsc4py import PETSc
#+END_SRC

must be placed /after/ this initialization. To sum up, a typical initialization sequence of  =petsc4py= should look something like

#+BEGIN_SRC python :exports code
  import sys
  import petsc4py

  petsc4py.init(sys.argv)

  from petsc4py import PETSc
#+END_SRC

It took me some time (and Lissandro's help) to figure out that switching the las two lines (although more good looking) was wrong...
