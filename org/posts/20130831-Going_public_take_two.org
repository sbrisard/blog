Well, I've been silent for a looooong time. I'd like to revive this blog. Not sure I will ever finish [[file:./20111004-Towards_polarization_methods-01.org][this]] (excellent!) series on polarization techniques, though.

I have recently started to work on high performance computing for image analysis and numerical simulation of heterogeneous materials. I used to develop all my computations in Java, but recently moved to Python (why I did that may be the topic of a future post). I also started working with [[http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/][PETSc]] (using Lisandro Dalcin's excellent [[https://bitbucket.org/petsc/petsc4py][petsc4py]] Python bindings) as well as [[http://cython.org/][Cython]]. I intend to report on technicalities regarding these tools/libraries.

Enjoy your read!
