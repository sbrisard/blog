* [[file:./posts/20140813-Review_of_Parallel_Programming_with_Python.org][2014-08-13 -- Review of "Parallel Programming with Python"]]

I have again recently been offered by [[http://www.packtpub.com/][Packt Publishing]] to review one of their books, entitled [[http://goo.gl/oMUSLW][Parallel Programming with Python]] (by Jan Palach).

* [[file:./posts/20140306-The_periodic_Green_operator_for_strains.org][2014-03-06 -- The periodic Green operator for strains]]

The Green operator for strains is defined as the linear operator which maps --in a homogeneous material-- the local prestress to the (opposite of the) local strain. Closed-form expressions of this operator can be derived in the case of periodic boundary conditions, as will be demonstrated in the present post.

* [[file:./posts/20140226-Decomposition_of_transverse_isotropic_fourth-rank_tensors.org][2014-02-26 -- Decomposition of transverse isotropic, fourth-rank tensors]]

In [[file:./posts/20140112-Elastic_constants_of_an_isotropic_material-03.org][a previous post]], I introduced the fourth-rank spherical and deviatoric projection tensors. Any isotropic fourth-rank tensor is a linear combination of these two tensors; in other words, the space of isotropic fourth-rank tensors (with minor and major symmetries) is of dimension 2. Similarly, it can be shown ([[file:./pages/references.org::#WALP1984][Walpole, 1984]]) that the space of three-dimensional, /transverse isotropic/ fourth-rank tensors (with minor and major symmetries) is of dimension 6. Furthermore; it is possible to produce a convenient basis of this space. This is the topic of the present post, which is mostly based on the paper by Walpole ([[file:./pages/references.org::#WALP1984][1984]]).

* [[file:./posts/20140219-On_the_double_dot_product.org][2014-02-19 -- On the double dot product]]

The double dot product of two tensors is the contraction of these tensors with respect to the last two indices of the first one, and the first two indices of the second one. Whether or not this contraction is performed on the /closest/ indices is a matter of convention. In this post, I will show that this choice has some important implications.

* [[file:./posts/20140131-The_elastic_acoustic_tensor_and_its_inverse.org][2014-01-31 -- The elastic acoustic tensor and its inverse]]

In this post, I will introduce the acoustic tensor of linearly elastic materials. Closed-form expressions of the inverse of this tensor can be derived in the case of /isotropic/ materials. This will later come in handy to derive closed-form expressions of the periodic Green operator for strains.
