#+TITLE: What is homogenization? Part 1: on the separation of scales

Most of my research activities deal with upscaling the mechanical properties of
heterogeneous materials. This is also known as homogenization. So what /is/
homogenization? This series explores this question; it is largely based on the
introduction to my [[file:./20171117-Announcing_the_defense_of_my_habilitation.org][Habilitation defense]].

In order to introduce homogenization, we will draw inspiration from the
publishing industry. The following photograph[fn:1] was published in /Le
Journal/ (a french daily newspaper) from thursday, may 30^th, 1935. It
illustrates the first cruise of the ocean liner [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Normandie][Normandie]].

From where you sit, water exhibits nice shades of gray. However, let us take a closer look at the prow:

It turns out that the sea has a /dotted/ structure, which is inherent to the
so-called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone][halftoning]] technique itself. Of course, the reason why the resulting
picture looks fine is because you are looking at it from far off. Also, the
size of the “gray” patches must be large enough for you to get the illusion
that it is smoothly shaded. Indeed, if the patch contains only a few dots, the
illusion will not take place.

We have therefore identified three length-scales

  - the /microscopic/ length-scale L_μ is the size of the dots,
  - the /mesoscopic/ length-scale L_m is the typical size of the patches,
  - the /macroscopic/ length-scale L_M is the distance from your screen to your
    eye.

These three scales must be well separated for the photograph to appear smoothly
shaded. I other words, the macro scale is much larger than the meso scale,
which in turn is much larger than the micro scale: L_μ \thinsp\ll\thinsp L_m
\thinsp\ll\thinsp L_M. This is the so-called assumption of /separation of
scales/.

Provided that separation of scales prevails, homogenization can take
place. Homogenization is the process of replacing the complex microstructure
with an equivalent, /homogeneous/ mesostructure. By /microstructure/, we mean
both the geometry and physical properties of the microscopic features. In the
above example, the microstructure is defined by the size and spacing of the
dots (geometry), as well as the color of dots and background (physical
properties). The /mesostructure/ on the other hand is a patch with homogeneous,
equivalent (in homogenization language, we say /effective/) properties. In the
above example, the effective property is the shade of gray as perceived by the
observer.

* Conclusion

In this post, we introduced the homogenization concept through a graphical
analogy. We explained that the key ingredient for homogenization to be valid is
separation of scales.

In the [[next][next instalment]] of this series, we will discuss to strategies to carry
out homogenization: the bottom-up and top-down approaches.
