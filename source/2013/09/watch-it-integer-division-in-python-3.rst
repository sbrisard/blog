**************************************
Watch it! Integer division in Python 3
**************************************

As of Python 3, the operator ``/`` performs a *true* division (floating-point result). If you are looking for an integer division (quotient of the Euclidean division), you must use ``//``. For example

.. code-block:: python

    >>> 1 / 2
    0.5
    >>> 5 // 2
    2

As far as I am concerned, I have no doubt that it will lead to endless debugging sessions!
